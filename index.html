        <h3>Johannes Fischer. Who is he? And why do I care?</h3>

<p>I'll answer the second question first. You seem to care, because you're here. Other than that, I've got nothing.</p>
<p>Now, for the second part: I was born in Germany, and raised in Hannover and in Nashville, TN. I recently graduated from <code><a href="http://uwc-usa.org">UWC USA</a></code> with an IB Diploma. I am now continuing my studies at Brandeis, while interning for my Congressman and managing a Domino's.</p>
<p>As for being an <strong>occasional genius</strong>, I consider it a blessing and a curse. Occasionally, I am a genius. I can put my ideas into perfect words, my ideas are great, and I appear super-human. However, for the majority of my time, I work to get back to my "temporary state of genius." Essentially, it is an embellished description of my perpetual battle of trying to acheive excellence.</p>
<p>I consider myself insightful, clever, and a leading figure. I spend my free time volunteering and working for First and Fourth Amendment Organizations, learning languages, and reading. My plan is to enter the world and work-force sprinting (Hopefully having received training from Usain Bolt). I will speak multiple languages (I'm 3 of 5 right now), have international experience, and an educational background suited for consulting, analysis, and leadership. I cannot wait for the first challenge that comes to face me. </p>
